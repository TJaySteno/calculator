## Calculator
### Reheating the Leftovers

A simple project to dip my toes back into the water. With this one, I'm just stretching the muscles I haven't been using and rediscovering the joy and addiction that is coding. I have three aims for this though: modularity, test-driven dev, and longevity.

Modularity: I've had a couple of passion projects that would benefited from a built-in calculator. My goal here is to have the logic for the entire thing in one place, in the most efficient form I can find so I can grab and drop wherever I'd like going forward.

Test-driven: Late into my learning, I was exposed to the idea of Test Driven Development. I never fully put it into practice, much to my detriment. I'm hoping that writing my tests first and coding second will flag the errors [I write in] earlier than previous ways that I was developing.

Longevity: As I look at my past projects, the packages they rely on deprecate too quickly for my liking. Therefore, the end product won't rely on any community packages from npm. I will still use ES7+ features though; my goal is only to future-proof the end product.

End of the day though, this is just meant as a fun, easy way to jump back into things. Hope you like it!

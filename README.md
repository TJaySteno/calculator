## Calculator
### Reheating the Leftovers

A simple project to dip my toes back into the water. With this one, I'm just stretching the muscles I haven't been using and rediscovering the joy and addiction that is coding. This will have two changes on my old style though; it'll be entirely modular and will be test-driven.

Modularity: I've had a couple of passion projects that would benefited from a built-in calculator. My goal here is to have the logic for the entire thing in one place, in the most efficient form I can find so I can grab and drop wherever I'd like going forward.

Test-driven: Late into my learning, I was exposed to the idea of Test Driven Development. I never fully put it into practice, much to my detriment. I'm hoping that writing my tests first and coding second will flag the errors [I write in] earlier than previous ways that I was developing.

End of the day though, this is just meant as a fun way to jump back into things.
